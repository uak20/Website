<p class="ex2">A large fraction of our genome consists of transposable elements, mobile DNA units that aim to increase in copy number by jumping between locations. TEs have been shown to be involved in the functioning and evolution of genomes, although their uncontrolled activity is detrimental to the host and must therefore be tightly monitored. Hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila (a syndrome that specifically affects germline development and is triggered by the P-element DNA transposon) was used as a model.</p>
<p class="ex2">Through a forward genetic screen, we have recently isolated a number of mutants that are able to suppress the hybrid dysgenesis-induced germline developmental defects, and using NGS and bioinformatic analysis, a few candidate genes were identified, mainly involved in the DNA damage/pathway. Similar genes (e.g., CHEK2) have been implicated in human diseases such as cancers, and aneuploidies like Down&rsquo;s Syndrome.</p>
<p class="ex2">The goal of this project was to use molecular and genetic tools (CRISPR-Cas9 system), as well as IF imaging of mutants to uncover mutations underlying the suppression of transposon-induced germline cell death. By carrying out fly crosses and characterising mutations, we were able to identify different gene variants that led to germline stem cell rescue, and the target in the pathway of these mutations.</p>
