<hr />
<p class="ex2">I am a current 5th year medical student at Gonville & Caius College in the University of Cambridge, holding a BA (Hons.) in Preclinical Medical Sciences and Genetics. I am a motivated, ambitious, and versatile medical student with varied interests, currently in my second year of clinical studies at the University of Cambridge, hoping to pursue academic research alongside a career in clinical surgical practice. I have been ambitious and high achieving throughout my academic life, having always had a passion for science. I have therefore undertaken multiple periods of biomedical and clinical research alongside my university studies, for which I have been awarded highly competitive research grants and scholarships at a local and national level. The chance to improve patient outcomes through research excites me. In the future, I aim to pursue a career in academic cardiothoracic surgery, as I have a passion for surgery which I am keen to combine with my interest in clinical research. I thoroughly enjoy investigative scientific work and am a hard-working and driven individual so will strive to achieve excellence in such a career.</p>
<p class="ex2">I have undertaken research in two different labs (Karam-Teixeira Lab, Ferguson-Smith/Hamilton Lab - both in the Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge). I have used a range of experimental approaches and practical techniques to approach my research questions. My work in the Karam-Teixeria Lab was wet-lab-based, using <em>D. melanogaster</em> as a model organism to investigate DNA damage responses in the germline stem cells. On the other hand, my Part II Research Project with Dr Russell Hamilton in the Ferguson-Smith Lab utilised structural bioinformatics to approach questions about the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi Syndrome, by investigating the role of snoRNAs in splicing, a very new field. I have further combined my knowledge in this novel field of RNA biology with my interest in cardiovascular disease and cardiothoracic surgery to investigate the roles of snoRNAs as genetic biomarkers for the development of future cardiovascular disease, as well as their suitability as biomarkers to inform choice of conduit in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Following these research projects, I have been successful in presenting my work at local, regional, national and international conferences, where my work has additionally been recognised with prizes such as the University of Cambridge 2022 Perelman Prize for the best clinical research presentation, as well as the 2022 Ronald Edwards Medal for the best scientific presentation at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery.

<p class="ex2">Alongside my university academic studies, I thoroughly enjoy music, specifically orchestral music and Baroque music. I have performed with the world-renowned Brecon Baroque ensemble under the direction of Rachel Podger, as well as in school, regional and national orchestras under conductors such as Natalia Luis-Bassa and Clark Rundell, and also as part of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. I have led my school and county orchestras, as well as the college orchestra and the Phoenix Music Society since coming up to Cambridge. I am the founder and President of the Cambridge University Medics' and Vets' Music Society, and the founding Vice-President of the Cambridge University Genetics Society, playing a role in our events with distinguished speakers such as Professor Dame Janet Thornton, Professor Richard Durbin and Professor Alfonso Martinez-Arias, key scientists within the field of genetics. I have additionally thoroughly enjoyed rowing for the Caius Boat Club and lately with the Addenbrooke's Boat Club, and rowing is something I hope to continue in the future.</p>
