<hr />
<p class="ex2">I am a motivated, ambitious, and versatile medical student with varied interests, currently undertaking Part II Genetics at the University of Cambridge, hoping to pursue academic research alongside a career in clinical surgical practice.</p>
<p class="ex2">I have undertaken research in two different labs (Karam-Teixeira Lab, Ferguson-Smith/Hamilton Lab - both in the Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge). I have used a range of experimental approaches and practical techniques to approach my research questions. My work in the Karam-Teixeria Lab was wet-lab-based, using <em>D. melanogaster</em> as a model organism to investigate DNA damage responses in the germline stem cells. On the other hand, my Part II Research Project with Dr Russell Hamilton in the Ferguson-Smith Lab utilised structural bioinformatics to approach questions about the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi Syndrome, by investigating the role of snoRNAs in splicing, a very new field.</p>
<p class="ex2">Alongside my university academic studies, I thoroughly enjoy music, specifically orchestral music and Baroque music. I have performed with the world-renowned Brecon Baroque ensemble under the direction of Rachel Podger, as well as in school, regional and national orchestras under conductors such as Natalia Luis-Bassa and Clark Rundell, and also as part of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. I have led my school and county orchestras, as well as the college orchestra and the Phoenix Music Society since coming up to Cambridge. I am the founder and President of the Cambridge University Medics' and Vets' Music Society, and the founding Vice-President of the Cambridge University Genetics Society, playing a role in our events with distinguished speakers such as Professor Dame Janet Thornton, Professor Richard Durbin and Professor Alfonso Martinez-Arias, key scientists within the field of genetics. I have additionally thoroughly enjoyed rowing for the Caius Boat Club, and rowing is something I hope to continue in the future.</p>
